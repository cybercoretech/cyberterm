# 📟 cyberterm

[![CI](https://github.com/cybercoretech/cyberterm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cybercoretech/cyberterm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/cybercoretech/cyberterm/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cybercoretech/cyberterm/actions/workflows/release.yml)

`Rust` · `wgpu` · `alacritty_terminal` · `glyphon`

**A GPU-rendered terminal emulator.** Real PTY handling and VT parsing via
`alacritty_terminal`, glyph rendering via `glyphon` (cosmic-text + etagere
on a wgpu pipeline), the Kitty keyboard protocol, shell integration with
prompt jumping, 129 themes out of the box (1,500+ with the optional
collections), and a config file that applies the moment you save it. No
Electron, no bundled shell.

**[cybercoretech.github.io/cyberterm](https://cybercoretech.github.io/cyberterm/)**

## 📦 Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybercoretech/cyberterm/main/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads the latest release for your platform (Linux x86_64/aarch64,
or macOS aarch64/Apple Silicon), verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and
installs `cyberterm` to `~/.local/bin`. Linux needs the usual desktop
GL/X11/Wayland libraries already present — nothing extra to install for
the binary itself. No Intel Mac build — GitHub's `macos-13` runner
queue capacity has been too degraded to build one reliably in CI; build
from source with `cargo build --release` there instead.

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install cyberterm
```

Builds the latest release from source. You need:
- **Rust:** 1.88 or newer.
- **A C compiler:** for the embedded Lua. On Arch, install `base-devel`.
- **Debian/Ubuntu:** also `libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`.

Then add shell integration to your shell's rc file. This is what command blocks, history and AI explanations rely on:

```bash
eval "$(cyberterm +shell-integration zsh)"   # or bash / fish
```

## 🚀 Commands

## ⌨️ Keys and mouse

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Copy / paste (bracketed paste when the program asks for it) |
| `Ctrl+Insert` / `Shift+Insert` | Copy / paste, so Omarchy's universal Super+C / Super+V work |
| Middle click | Paste the primary selection |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Select the whole scrollback |
| `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown` | Scroll a page |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Up` / `Ctrl+Shift+Down` | Scroll a line |
| `Shift+Home` / `Shift+End` | Top of the scrollback / back to the live screen |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+X` | Jump to the previous / next shell prompt |
| `Ctrl+Shift+K` | Clear the scrollback |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Find in the scrollback (Enter older, Shift+Enter newer) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+H` | Search command history (commands and their output) |
| `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0` | Bigger / smaller / reset font |
| `Ctrl+Shift+,` | Theme picker |
| `Ctrl+Shift+L` | Flight log: what the agent in this tab did |
| `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Changes: what the agent in this tab changed |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Tower: every agent session at once; jump, review, merge or discard |
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Reload the config now |

Rebind or free any of them under `[keybindings]` (`"ctrl+shift+k" = "none"`
hands that combo back to the shell).

Mouse: drag to select (double-click for a word, triple-click for a line,
Alt+drag for a block, Shift+click to extend). Finished selections are copied
to the primary selection by default; set `[mouse] copy_on_select` to
`"clipboard"` or `"both"` to have them land on the regular clipboard too.
Right-click opens a menu with Copy, Paste, Select All, Open/Copy Link,
Clear Scrollback, Themes and Reload Config (Shift+right-click while a
program has mouse reporting on). The wheel scrolls the scrollback; in full-screen programs
without mouse support (`less`, `man`) it sends arrow keys. Programs that
turn on mouse reporting (vim, htop, tmux, fzf) get clicks, drags and the
wheel in SGR, UTF-8 or X10 encoding; hold Shift to select text anyway.
Hyperlinks, both OSC 8 links and plain `https://` URLs, underline on hover
and open with Ctrl+click.

## 🪟 Splits and tabs

Splits and tabs use Ghostty's default keys, so Ghostty muscle memory carries
over:

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Shift+O` / `Ctrl+Shift+E` | Split right / down |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W` | Close the pane (the window closes with the last one) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Arrows` | Move focus between panes |
| `Ctrl+Super+]` / `Ctrl+Super+[` | Next / previous pane |
| `Ctrl+Super+Shift+Arrows` | Resize (Omarchy's `+Alt` variant works too) |
| `Ctrl+Super+Shift+=` | Equalize splits |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | Zoom the pane to the whole tab (toggle) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+B` | Broadcast: type into every pane of the tab (toggle) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+T` | New tab |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous tab |
| `Alt+1`…`Alt+8`, `Alt+9` | Go to tab N, last tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp/PageDown` | Move the tab left / right |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` | New window |

New panes and tabs open in the focused shell's directory. Click a pane to
focus it, drag a divider to resize, click a tab to switch, middle-click it
to close. Unfocused panes are dimmed (`[splits] inactive_dim`), the tab bar
shows while there's more than one tab (`[tabs] bar`), and a tab with an
unseen bell gets a dot.

**tmux users:** set `[keyboard] leader = "ctrl+b"` (or any key) and use
tmux's keys after it: `%` `"` split, `x` close, `z` zoom, `o` next pane,
arrows focus, `Ctrl+arrows` resize, `c` new tab, `n`/`p` next/previous,
`1`–`9`, `&` close tab. Press the leader twice to send it to the program.
Add your own as `"leader+v" = "split_right"`.

### Layouts as code

Put a `.cyberterm/layout.toml` in a project and `cyberterm +layout` opens
the whole workspace: tabs, splits and what runs where. Commands are typed
into a shell once its prompt is up, so the shell stays when they exit.

```toml
[[tab]]
title = "dev"
[tab.layout]
split = "right"
ratio = 0.6
[[tab.layout.panes]]
command = "nvim ."
focus = true
[[tab.layout.panes]]
split = "down"
panes = [{ command = "cargo watch -x test" }, { command = "npm run dev", cwd = "web" }]

[[tab]]
title = "logs"
layout = { command = "journalctl --user -f" }
```

### Sessions that outlive the window

Turn on the session daemon and closing a window (or a crash) no longer ends
its shells:

```toml
[daemon]
enabled = true
```

The daemon (`cyberterm +daemon`) starts on demand and owns every shell. A
window attaches to a session, gets an exact replay of each pane (scrollback,
colors, links, prompt marks, full-screen apps like vim or less), then the
live output. Close the window and the session detaches: builds keep
building, servers keep serving. Open Cyberterm again and the most recent
detached session comes back with its tabs and splits (`[daemon] reattach`),
or pick one with `cyberterm +attach <name>`. `cyberterm +sessions` lists
them; the daemon exits by itself once the last session ends.

**From another terminal or over SSH:** `cyberterm +attach` with no display
(an SSH login, a console), or with `--tty`, attaches inside the terminal
you're in. It draws the active tab's splits as text with a status line;
keys go straight to the focused pane, and the pane's input modes
(application keys, bracketed paste, mouse, Kitty keyboard) are mirrored onto
your terminal so programs behave as they would locally. Bells, titles and
clipboard copies (OSC 52) reach your terminal too.

Commands are `Ctrl+\` then a key: `d` detach, `%` / `"` split, `x` close,
`z` zoom, `o` or arrows to move between panes, `c` new tab, `n` / `p` /
`1`–`9` tabs, `&` close tab, `b` broadcast, `?` help; `Ctrl+\` twice
sends it to the program. A session open in a window can be taken over with
`--force` (the window says so). With no detached session to resume,
`cyberterm +attach` starts a new one, like `tmux new -A`.

### Control socket

A running Cyberterm listens on a user-only Unix socket
(`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cyberterm/<pid>.sock`, exported to its shells as
`CYBERTERM_SOCKET`). It speaks JSON-RPC 2.0, one request per line, and
`cyberterm +ctl` wraps it:

```bash
cyberterm +ctl list-panes                             # ids, titles, cwds, sizes, last exit codes
cyberterm +ctl split direction=down command="htop"    # returns the new pane id
cyberterm +ctl get-text pane=3 lines=50               # plain text, ready to pipe
cyberterm +ctl send-text pane=3 text=$'make test\r'
cyberterm +ctl new-tab title=logs cwd=~/src command="tail -f app.log"
```

This is the same API Lua scripts and the MCP bridge for AI agents use. Turn it off with `[control] enabled = false`.

### Command palette

**Ctrl+Shift+P** opens one searchable list of everything you can do:
- **Actions:** every action, with its shortcut.
- **Your Lua commands.**
- **Open tabs and panes:** jump straight to one.
- **Themes:** switch instantly.
- **Recent commands from history:** Enter types one at the prompt, Ctrl+Enter also runs it.

Type a few letters ("spr" finds *Split right*) and press **Enter**. Items you picked recently come first.

## 🧱 Command blocks and history

With shell integration on, every command becomes a **block**:

- **Margin bar:** each block gets a colored bar (green succeeded, red failed, yellow still running).
- **Badge:** each block shows its exit code and how long it took, e.g. `✓ 1.2s`, `✗ 2 · 3.4s`.
- **Right-click a block** to:
  - copy its output or command
  - **rerun** it (in place, or in a new pane)
  - **watch** it (a pane that reruns it every 2 seconds)
  - **diff its output with the previous run**, from the scrollback or from history
- **Last command's output:** `Ctrl+Shift+G` opens it in a pager; `Ctrl+Shift+Y` copies it.
- **Long commands:** when one that ran 10s or more finishes while you're looking elsewhere (another window, tab or pane), you get a desktop notification (`[notify] long_command_seconds`).

**History with output.** Finished commands are saved to a searchable SQLite
database (`~/.local/share/cyberterm/history.sqlite3`): the command, its
output, exit code, directory, timing, host and session, from every window
and the daemon. Common secrets (tokens, keys, passwords, private keys) are
redacted before anything is written; commands typed with a leading space
are never saved, and `[history] ignore` takes extra patterns.

```bash
cyberterm +history                      # recent commands
cyberterm +history curl health          # commands or output containing both words
cyberterm +history --failed --here      # failures in this directory
cyberterm +history --output 42          # everything command 42 printed
```

The same search is on the control socket (`cyberterm +ctl history query=...`),
and in the window with **Ctrl+Shift+H**:

- **Search:** type to search commands and their output.
- **Preview:** the selected command's saved output is shown below the list.
- **Keys:** Enter puts the command at your prompt, Ctrl+Enter runs it, Tab opens its full output in a pane.

### Smart output

- **File references:** `src/main.rs:42:7`, Rust's `--> src/x.rs:12:5`, compiler and linter errors, `grep -n` output, Node and Go stack traces, Python's `File "x.py", line 12` and `file.cs(12,5)`.
  - They underline on hover; Ctrl+click (or right-click → Open) opens them in your editor at that line.
  - Paths resolve against the directory the command ran in, and only existing files are linked.
  - The editor comes from `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`. Terminal editors (nvim, vim, helix, nano, micro, kakoune) open in a new pane, GUI editors (VS Code, Zed, Sublime) in their own window. `[links] editor` takes a template such as `"nvim +{line} {file}"`.
- **JSON:** a block whose output is JSON gets **View as JSON** in its menu, which opens `cyberterm +json`: a collapsible tree.
  - Arrows/`hjkl` move, Enter folds, `e`/`c` expand or collapse everything.
  - `/` searches, `y` copies the node's path (`.items[3].name`) and `Y` its value.
  - It works on its own too: `curl -s api/health | cyberterm +json`, including JSON Lines.

## 🤖 AI agents

`cyberterm +mcp` is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so any agent that speaks MCP can work with your terminal: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Zed and others.

```bash
claude mcp add cyberterm -- cyberterm +mcp     # Claude Code
codex mcp add cyberterm -- cyberterm +mcp      # Codex CLI
# anything else: command "cyberterm", args ["+mcp"], stdio transport
```

- **Tools:** `list_panes`, `read_pane`, `recent_commands` (command, exit code, duration and output), `search_history`, `run_command` (in a new pane), `wait_for_command`, `send_text`.
  - Run from inside Cyberterm, the agent works with that window; from elsewhere, with the most recently started one.
- **You stay in charge:**
  - The first time an agent reads a pane, a prompt asks you. Typing into a pane or running a command asks every time.
  - Answer with **Enter** to allow once, **a** to allow for that pane (or, for commands, from then on), or **Esc** to deny.
  - What will be typed is shown with Enter and control keys made visible, so nothing hides in it.
  - Commands run in a new pane split below yours, so you see them and keep your focus.
- **You can see what agents do:**
  - Panes an agent works with show a `◆ agent-name` badge.
  - Right-click → **Revoke Agent Access** withdraws its grants for that pane.
  - Every request is logged to `~/.local/state/cyberterm/agents.log`.
- **Settings:** `[agents]` sets `read` and `write` to `"ask"`, `"allow"` or `"deny"`; `enabled = false` turns agent access off.

The prompts keep well-behaved agents from acting silently. They aren't a sandbox: a program already running as you can reach the control socket directly.

### Agent sessions

Run any coding agent in a git worktree of its own, in a tab of its own:

```bash
cyberterm +agent claude fix the flaky login test   # or codex, gemini, copilot, opencode, crush, ...
cyberterm +agent                                   # the agent home: your agents and sessions at a glance
cyberterm +agent claude,codex,gemini fix the flaky login test   # several agents on one task, to compare
cyberterm +agent merge fix-the-flaky-login         # bring its work into your branch as one commit
cyberterm +agent discard fix-the-flaky-login       # or throw it away
```

- **Any agent:**
  - Cyberterm offers the agents it finds on your PATH: Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Cursor Agent, opencode, Crush, Grok, pi, oh-my-pi, Antigravity, Muse Code, Hermes, Ori, Aider, Goose, Amp, and others.
  - Add any other command under `[agents.launch.<name>]`.
  - The task goes where each agent takes it (as an argument, or after a flag like `-i`), or is shown before it starts.
- **Its own worktree:**
  - Each session gets `../<repo>-<id>` on a new branch `agent/<id>`, so agents never trample each other or your checkout.
  - `--no-worktree` runs it in place instead.
- **From the palette:** **New agent: …** in the command palette starts one for the current pane's directory.
- **Recognised wherever it runs:**
  - Agent tabs are titled and badged (`◆ Claude Code · fix-the-flaky-login`).
  - This works for daemon sessions too: close the window and the agent keeps working, and reattaching picks it back up.
- **Merge or discard:**
  - `+agent merge <id>` brings the session's work into the branch it started from: one squashed commit titled with the task by default, or `--merge` (a merge commit) or `--ff` (fast-forward). Anything the agent left uncommitted is committed onto its branch first. Then the worktree, branch and session go (`--keep` keeps them).
  - **Checked before anything changes:** it won't start while the agent runs, while your checkout is on another branch or has uncommitted changes, or when the work conflicts. Conflicts are found with `git merge-tree`, which touches no files, and listed by name.
  - `--check` shows what a merge would do without doing it. `[agents] merge = "merge"` or `"ff"` changes the default.
  - `+agent discard <id>` throws a session's work away (worktree, branch and session) after asking; `--yes` skips the question.
- **Careful cleanup:** `+agent rm` refuses while the agent runs or while its worktree has uncommitted changes or commits (`--force` overrides). It deletes the branch only when nothing was committed on it.

#### Flight log

Every agent session keeps a flight log: the prompts it was given, the commands it ran (exit code, duration and, where the agent reports it, output), the files it edited, and when it waited for you or finished.

```bash
cyberterm +agent log                    # the latest session
cyberterm +agent log fix-the-flaky-login -o -f   # with output, following live
```

**In the window,** the Flight log sits beside the agent's tab. It opens by itself when an agent starts, and `Ctrl+Shift+L` opens it, gives it the keyboard, or closes it.

- **Beside the agent, not over it:** the agent's panes really shrink, so it always sees its true width.
- **Where it stands:** working, **needs you**, done or stopped, with counts of commands, failures and edits.
- **What it did:** prompts, commands with ✓/✗ and how long they took, edits and other tools, newest at the bottom.
  - A failed command shows its last line of output.
  - With the keyboard: **↑↓** select, **Enter** opens a command's output, **y** copies it, **Esc** hands the keyboard back.
- **On the tab:** `◆` working, `◆!` needs you (in the alert color), `✓` done.
- **A desktop notification** says when an agent you're not looking at needs you or has finished.
- **Where "needs you" comes from:** the agent's hooks, or a desktop notification it sends through the terminal (OSC 9 or OSC 777, which Codex and others use).
- **After the agent quits,** the tab keeps its log.

#### Changes

`Ctrl+Shift+M` (or `c` in the Flight log) shows what the agent in this tab changed: its worktree compared with where it started. That covers the commits it made, the work it hasn't committed yet, and new files.

- **The layout:** files on the left with `+`/`−` counts, the agent's commits below them, and the selected file's diff on the right with line numbers.
- **It keeps up:** the view refreshes while the agent works.
- **Keys:** **↑↓** choose a file, **PgUp/PgDn** scroll, **e** opens it in your editor at the first change, **y** copies its path.
- **r puts a file back** the way it was when the agent started, after asking. A file the agent created is removed.
- **It's plain git** in the worktree, so it works the same for every agent, and your own diff settings don't change it.

#### Tower

`Ctrl+Shift+S` shows every agent session at once, over the tab: the sessions on the left, the selected one's flight log on the right.

- **At a glance:** each session's state (◆ working, ◆! needs you, ✓ done, ○ stopped), its agent, how long since it last did something, its branch, and what it changed (`+`/`−` lines, files, commits). The header counts the ones that need you.
- **Keys:**
  - **↵** jumps to the session's tab, or opens a shell in its worktree.
  - **c** opens its Changes (Esc comes back to the Tower).
  - **m** merges its work into the branch it started from (`+agent merge`). It checks first and asks, showing what it will do.
  - **d** discards it, after asking.
  - **n** starts a new agent.
- **It keeps up:** sessions are re-read every couple of seconds while it's open, and merges run in the background, so a slow commit hook never freezes the window.
- **Finished but still open:** most agents stay open after they finish. For a session marked ✓ done, m and d offer to quit the agent first ("Quit Claude Code and merge …?"). One that's still working is never stopped. Afterwards its tab closes, if all that's left in it is an idle shell.

#### Several agents on one task

Give the same task to several agents and keep the best result:

```bash
cyberterm +agent claude,codex,gemini fix the flaky login test
```

- **Separate attempts:** each agent gets its own worktree and tab (`fix-the-flaky-login-claude`, `…-codex`, …). The same agent twice works too (`claude,claude`).
- **Side by side:** the Tower joins a task's attempts with a bar down their left edge, so their changes, commits and flight logs can be compared.
- **Keep one:** merging one asks whether to discard the others, quitting any that are still open. From the command line, `+agent merge` names the leftover attempts and the `+agent discard` command for them.
- **Inside Cyberterm, in a git repository:** several attempts at once need their own tabs and worktrees.

It works with any agent, at the level of detail each one allows:

| Source | Agents | What it records |
|---|---|---|
| Shell recorder | any agent that runs commands through `bash` or `zsh` (most do) | every command: text, directory, exit code, duration |
| Native hooks | Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Hermes | prompts, command output and exit codes, edits, other tools, waiting / done |
| Open format | anything: another agent's hooks, a plugin, a wrapper script | whatever it sends |

- **The shell recorder** turns on through `BASH_ENV` and `ZDOTDIR` for the agent only. Your own startup files still run exactly as before (your `BASH_ENV`, `.zshenv`, `.zprofile`, `.zshrc`, `.zlogin` and `ZDOTDIR`). Commands run through `sh -c` aren't recorded.
- **Claude Code's hooks** are added for that session only (`--settings`); your Claude configuration isn't touched.
- **Codex's hooks** are added for that session only (`-c`). Codex asks you to review hooks it hasn't seen, so approve Cyberterm's once (**Trust all and continue**) on your first Codex agent; they're remembered after that. Codex also asks to trust each new folder, so expect that question for every new worktree.
- **Copilot CLI's hooks** are added for that session only, in a plugin of Cyberterm's own (`--plugin-dir`); your Copilot configuration isn't touched.
- **Gemini CLI, Cursor and Hermes** can't take hooks for one session, so they're opt-in, one command each:
  - `cyberterm +agent setup gemini` adds Cyberterm's hooks to `~/.gemini/settings.json`.
  - `cyberterm +agent setup cursor` adds them to `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. The Cursor CLI doesn't fire prompt hooks yet, so prompts aren't recorded for it.
  - `cyberterm +agent setup hermes` adds a small plugin in `~/.hermes/plugins/cyberterm` and enables it with `hermes plugins enable`, so Cyberterm never edits Hermes's `config.yaml` itself.
  - **Beside yours:** they go next to any hooks you already have.
  - **Inert elsewhere:** they do nothing outside Cyberterm's agent sessions.
  - **Reversible:** `--remove` takes them out again, and the file is backed up first.
- `cyberterm +agent setup` lists what each of your agents reports.
- **The open format** is one JSON object per line on the stdin of `cyberterm +hook event`, inside an agent session (or with `--session <id>`):

  ```bash
  echo '{"kind":"command","command":"pytest -x","exit":1,"duration_ms":4200,"output":"1 failed"}' | cyberterm +hook event
  ```

  The kinds are `prompt` (`text`), `command_start` and `command` (`id`, `command`, `cwd`, `exit`, `duration_ms`, `output`), `edit` (`path`, `tool`), `tool` (`tool`, `text`), `waiting` (`text`), `done`, `session_start` and `session_end`.
- **Storage:** logs live next to the sessions in `~/.local/state/cyberterm/agents/<id>.jsonl`. `+hook` never fails the agent that calls it.

```toml
[agents]
worktrees = true        # false: agents run in the current directory
worktree_dir = ""       # empty: next to the repository
record_commands = true  # the shell recorder
hooks = true            # agents' own hooks (Claude Code)
panel = true            # open the Flight log by itself for new agents
panel_width = 0         # columns; 0 sizes it to the window

[agents.launch.aider]
command = "aider --model sonnet"
prompt = "none"         # "positional", a flag such as "--message", or "none"
```

### Ask and Explain

Cyberterm can also ask a model for help:

- **Explain this error:** a failed command's right-click menu has **Explain with AI**, and **Ctrl+Shift+J** explains the newest failure in the pane. The model gets the command, its exit code and output, the directory and git state, and returns what went wrong plus a fix when there is one.
- **Plain English to a command:** **Ctrl+Shift+I**, then type what you want ("find files over 100MB here", "undo my last commit but keep the changes").

Answers come with a risk rating: safe, caution or dangerous. Cyberterm also checks the command itself for things like recursive deletes, force-pushes, `curl | sh`, disk writes and `sudo`, and raises the rating if the model rated it too low.

**Enter** types the command at your prompt. It never runs until you press Enter yourself. **c** copies it, **Esc** closes the panel.

Pick a provider in `[ai]`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "anthropic"                   # key in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; model defaults to claude-opus-5-5
# provider = "openai"                    # any OpenAI-compatible API (key in OPENAI_API_KEY)
# model = "gpt-5"
# provider = "openai"                    # Ollama or LM Studio on this machine, no key
# base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
# model = "qwen3:8b"
# provider = "command"                   # any CLI that reads the prompt on stdin
# command = ["claude", "-p"]
```

Before anything is sent, command output is redacted (tokens, passwords and keys are stripped, as in saved history) and trimmed to the last 12,000 characters (`max_context_chars`). The panel header shows which model and host it goes to.

## 🛡 Power features

### Danger mode

A pane turns red when a mistake there would cost more:
- it's connected over SSH to a host matching `[danger] hosts` (default `*prod*`);
- it's running a root shell (`sudo -i`, `su`);
- it's sitting in a directory matching `[danger] paths`;
- or you marked it with **Ctrl+Shift+D** (press again to unmark).

A dangerous pane gets a red border, a faint red tint, a `⚠ ssh prod-db` badge and a `⚠` on its tab.

If you press Enter on a risky command there, Cyberterm holds the Enter and shows the command with the reason (for example "deletes recursively", "force-pushes"). Enter again runs it, and any other key cancels.
- **What counts as risky:** the same check the AI panel uses. `confirm = "caution"` also covers sudo, overwrites and kills; `"off"` turns the check off.
- **Programs that take over the screen:** full-screen programs such as editors and pagers are left alone.
- **Over SSH:** it works without shell integration on the remote side.

Detection reads `/proc` once a second, so `ssh prod-db` and `exit` change the pane's state on their own. AI agents see a pane's danger state in `list_panes`, and their consent prompts flag a dangerous target.

### SSH-aware splits

Splitting a pane that's in an `ssh` session opens the new pane on the same host, with the same options (`-p`, `-i`, `-J` and so on).
- **Remote directory:** if the remote shell reports its directory (OSC 7, which Cyberterm's shell integration or many distros' default bash config send), the new pane also opens in that directory.
- **Local shell underneath:** the new pane is a local shell with the `ssh` command typed into it, so the command is in your history and you're back in a local shell when you exit.
- **Local split instead:** right-click → **Split Right/Down (Local Shell)**, or set `[splits] follow_ssh = false` to turn this off.
- **Not followed:** sessions that aren't logins, such as `ssh host cmd`, `-N` forwarding, `-f` and `-W`.

Each pane is its own connection. To log in only once, let new panes share the first connection with an SSH ControlMaster:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host *
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%C
  ControlPersist 10m
```

### Rewind

**Ctrl+Shift+U** (or right-click → **Rewind…**) steps back through what a pane's screen showed: a TUI's earlier state, output wiped by `clear`, a progress display halfway through.
- **Moving around:** **←/→** move between moments (each point where output paused), **Shift** moves 10 at a time, **Home/End** jump to the ends.
- **Copying:** **y** copies the screen as it was then.
- **Leaving:** **Esc** returns to the live pane.
- **The program keeps running:** rewind only changes what's drawn.

Each pane keeps its last 2 MiB of output (`[rewind] buffer_kb`), daemon panes included. Older output is folded into a starting screen, so the earliest moment still looks right.

Recording costs about a quarter of raw throughput when a single command dumps tens of megabytes. `[rewind] enabled = false` turns it off.

### Inline images

Cyberterm speaks the kitty graphics protocol, so `kitten icat`, timg, chafa, viu, yazi, ranger previews and matplotlib's kitty backend can show images in the terminal.
- **How placement works:** each image row is anchored in the grid, so images scroll with the text, stay in the scrollback, show up in rewind and work in daemon panes.
- **Supported:** PNG/RGB/RGBA, zlib compression, chunked transfers, and data sent directly or through files (including `/dev/shm`). Placement, query and delete are supported too.
- **Not supported yet:** shared-memory transfer, animation and z-index; images are drawn over text.

### Live ports

Start a dev server (`npm run dev`, `cargo run`, `python -m http.server`) and a `:3000` chip appears in the pane's corner within a second. Click it, or right-click → **Open localhost:3000**, to open it in your browser.
- **Which ports:** only ports opened by programs started in that pane, read from `/proc`.
- **When the server stops:** the chip disappears.
- **Who else sees them:** `list_panes` reports them too, so scripts and AI agents can find your dev server.
- **Settings:** `[ports] url` changes what a click opens.

## 🌙 Lua scripting

Put a script in `~/.config/cyberterm/init.lua`. It runs in an embedded Lua 5.4, with no system Lua needed, and reloads as soon as you save it.

```lua
-- Tell me when a command fails, with its first line of output.
cyberterm.on("command_finished", function(ev)
  if ev.exit ~= 0 then
    local first = ev.output():match("[^\n]+") or ""
    cyberterm.status(("✗ %s exited %d: %s"):format(ev.command, ev.exit, first))
  end
end)

-- A long build finished while I was elsewhere: desktop notification.
cyberterm.on("command_finished", function(ev)
  if ev.duration_ms and ev.duration_ms > 60000 then
    cyberterm.notify("Done: " .. ev.command, "exit " .. tostring(ev.exit))
  end
end)

-- Ctrl+Alt+G: lazygit in a split below.
cyberterm.bind("ctrl+alt+g", function()
  cyberterm.split{ direction = "down", command = "lazygit" }
end)

-- `cyberterm +ctl lua name=dev` opens my dev layout.
cyberterm.command("dev", function()
  cyberterm.new_tab{ title = "server", command = "npm run dev" }
  cyberterm.split{ direction = "right", command = "npm test -- --watch" }
end)
```

| API | |
|---|---|
| `cyberterm.on(event, fn)` | `startup`, `pane_created`, `focus_changed`, `command_started`, `command_finished`. Command events carry `pane`, `command`, `cwd`, `exit`, `duration_ms`, and `output()` (fetched on demand). |
| `cyberterm.bind(keys, fn)` | A key combo (same syntax as `[keybindings]`) runs `fn`. Script bindings take precedence over the built-in ones. |
| `cyberterm.command(name, fn)` | Run with `cyberterm +ctl lua name=… args='[…]'`; the return value is printed. |
| `cyberterm.after(ms, fn)` | Run `fn` once, later. |
| `panes()`, `focused()`, `tabs()`, `get_text(pane, lines)`, `blocks(pane, n, output)`, `history(query)` | Read the terminal. |
| `send_text(pane, text)`, `paste(pane, text)`, `split{…}`, `new_tab{…}`, `focus(pane)`, `close(pane)`, `set_title(text)` | Act on it. |
| `status(text)`, `notify(title, body)`, `copy(text)`, `log(…)` | Messages, notifications, clipboard, `~/.local/state/cyberterm/lua.log`. |
| `call(method, params)` | Any control-socket method (`cyberterm +ctl help`). |

**Safety:**
- **Runaway scripts:** a script that runs longer than 2 seconds is stopped and the window keeps working.
- **Errors:** they show in red along the bottom of the pane, with the line number, and go to `lua.log`.
- **AI agents:** they can't run Lua.
- **Turning it off:** `[lua] enabled = false`; `script` points at a different file.

## 🐚 Shell integration

```bash
eval "$(cyberterm +shell-integration zsh)"    # ~/.zshrc
eval "$(cyberterm +shell-integration bash)"   # ~/.bashrc
cyberterm +shell-integration fish | source    # ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

The script makes the shell report its working directory (OSC 7), mark each
prompt and command (OSC 133) and send the command line itself. That powers
prompt jumping, command blocks, history and opening new panes in the same
directory. Re-source it after upgrading to pick up the command line.
The marks are stored on the terminal cells themselves, so they scroll,
reflow on resize and age out of the scrollback with the text they belong to.
The escapes are harmless in other terminals.

## 🛠 Configuration

`~/.config/cyberterm/cyber_config.toml`. Every key is optional, and changes
apply within a second of saving. Run `cyberterm +default-config` for the full
commented reference:

```toml
theme = "synthwave_84"
opacity = 0.9

[font]
family = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"
size = 9.0            # points, like Ghostty/Kitty/Alacritty
line_height = 1.25
fallback = ["Symbols Nerd Font Mono", "Noto Color Emoji"]

[cursor]
style = "block"       # block | beam | underline
blinking = false

[scrollback]
lines = 10000

[clipboard]
osc52 = "copy"        # disabled | copy | paste | copy-paste

[keybindings]
"ctrl+alt+c" = "copy"
```

### Themes

**129 themes come with Cyberterm:**
- **12 built-in:** Cyberterm's own.
- **36 popular ones:** Catppuccin (all four), Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, One Dark/Light, Kanagawa, Everforest, Monokai Pro, GitHub and more, from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) (MIT).
- **81 from the shared Cybercore catalog.**

**Add more on request** (`cyberterm +themes` lists what's installed):

```bash
cyberterm +themes install iterm2      # 768 themes, iTerm2-Color-Schemes (MIT)
cyberterm +themes install kitty       # 418 themes, kovidgoyal/kitty-themes (GPL-3.0, for your own use)
cyberterm +themes install cyberterm   # 200+ extras: games, movies, music, sub-cyber
cyberterm +themes install all         # all of them: 1,500+ themes
cyberterm +themes remove kitty
```

Collections are downloaded into `~/.config/cyberterm/themes/<name>/`, each with its license, rather than built into the binary. Running `install` again updates a collection.

**The picker (`Ctrl+Shift+,`):**
- **Finding a theme:** type to filter by name or family, with themes grouped under their family.
- **Previewing:** the whole window previews the highlighted theme, with a sample of output in its colors.
- **Choosing:** Enter applies it and saves it, Esc goes back to the theme you had, and Ctrl+N creates a new one.
- **Elsewhere:** the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) lists every theme too.

**Your own themes:**
- **Kitty-format files:** any `.conf` file works unmodified, at the top of the themes folder or in a folder of its own (which becomes its family).
- **JSON:** `+edit-theme` writes your own themes as JSON under a `category/folder/` layout.

**The shared Cybercore catalog:**
- **Colors:** its eight semantic colors fill the terminal's normal ANSI slots, and Cyberterm derives the bright eight (lighter on dark themes, deeper on light ones).
- **Your choice applies everywhere:** choosing a Cybercore theme saves it to the shared catalog, so other Cybercore apps follow.
- **And the other way round:** Cyberterm checks the catalog once a second, so changes from Theme Studio or another Cybercore app apply without a restart.

## ⚙️ Rendering

- **Text:** `glyphon` (cosmic-text shaping + an etagere glyph atlas) on wgpu,
  with bold, italic, dim, strikethrough and five underline styles (single,
  double, curly, dotted, dashed), including colored underlines.
- **Alignment:** each row is cut into ASCII runs plus individually placed
  wide and non-ASCII glyphs (CJK, emoji, Nerd Font icons, combining marks).
  A fallback font with a different advance width can't push the rest of the
  line out of alignment.
- **Shaping cache:** shaping is cached by row content, so scrolling and
  redraws don't re-shape unchanged text.
- **Fonts:** only the configured fonts are loaded at startup. The first time
  a character none of them covers appears, fontconfig finds a font that has
  it.
- **Box drawing:** box-drawing and block-element characters are drawn as
  rectangles from the cell geometry, so TUI borders join seamlessly at any
  font size or line height.
- **Opacity:** window opacity fades cell backgrounds only. Text stays fully
  opaque, matching how Ghostty/Kitty/Alacritty do transparency.

## 🗺 Known limitations

- Without `[daemon] enabled`, shells live in the window's process and end
  with it. The daemon is opt-in while it's new.
- The terminal attach client has no scrollback view of its own yet (use the
  program's own scrolling or attach from a window), and forwards mouse
  reports only to programs using SGR mouse mode (nearly all do).
- No scrollback search yet.
- No sixel or Kitty graphics protocol (inline images) yet.
